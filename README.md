## Summary
### Looking at the data provided above, we can conclude that there is not a bias in the paid reviews, with the non-paid reviews actually being a little higher for 5 star reviews.
### I think it would be interesting to look at the one star reviews and see if there is a bias on the 'paid vine reviews to not rank the product low.
